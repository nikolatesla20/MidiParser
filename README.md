MidiParser
==========

Open a type 1 MIDI file and display it's basic information on the console

This is a Java example of opening a MIDI file, mainly a drum pattern file, and displaying that file's "pattern" as X's and -'s on the console.

So a basic 4 on the floor beat would look like so:

X---X---X---X

Each Type 1 MIDI track will have its own line

Gives you collection of track objects which contain each event on the track.
